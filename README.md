*Apisuru* is a bee frame design featuring sensor panels and pockets for electronics that is designed for manufacturing with 3D printing. The frame dimensions are based on the widely used [Langstroth Hive](https://beeprofessor.com/langstroth-hive-dimensions/). Foundation can be installed inside the frame by sliding it between the rails in the upper and lower bars.

By integrating sensors, *Apisuru* could provide remote monitoring of real-time data on pressure, temperature, humidity, sound, and light levels. Tracking these parameters could help identify patterns related to hive health, such as pest invasions or environmental stressors.

Presently, existing frames do not have pockets or channels for wires to pass through. Adding electronics to existing frames increases the chances of the electronics being frozen in [propolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propolis), and not able to be re-used for future experiments.

To keep the sensors and electronics clear of the brood area, the sensor panels are placed near the outer arc of the rainbow pattern. The sensor plates are barebones, intended to be modified with whatever your custom sensor plan will be. 

Apisuru is open source and available under the CERN OHL license. Let us know if you are interested in adapting Apisuru for an experiment in your hive this bee season!



## Sensor Panels

Each location with a sensor panel available has the naming convention of \_F*x*B*y*, where x and y could be 0 or 1. 0 represents that the piece is not filled, meaning, it does have the space and mounting points for a sensor panel. 1 represents that the piece is filled. 

Sensor panels are located on:
- Side upper (left and right)
- Side lower (left and right)
- Lower bar middle
- Upper bar middle

The corresponding sensor_plate matches with the piece.
